/**
 * Demonstrates the behavior of <code>StatefulJob</code>s, as well as how misfire instructions affect the firings of
 * triggers of <code>StatefulJob</code> s - when the jobs take longer to execute that the frequency of the trigger's
 * repitition.
 * <p>
 * While the example is running, you should note that there are two triggers with identical schedules, firing identical
 * jobs. The triggers "want" to fire every 3 seconds, but the jobs take 10 seconds to execute. Therefore, by the time
 * the jobs complete their execution, the triggers have already "misfired" (unless the scheduler's "misfire threshold"
 * has been set to more than 7 seconds). You should see that one of the jobs has its misfire instruction set to
 * <code>SimpleTrigger.MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_NOW_WITH_EXISTING_REPEAT_COUNT</code>- which causes it to fire
 * immediately, when the misfire is detected. The other trigger uses the default "smart policy" misfire instruction,
 * which causes the trigger to advance to its next fire time (skipping those that it has missed) - so that it does not
 * refire immediately, but rather at the next scheduled time.
 * </p>
